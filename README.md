 <h1>CALENDER</h1>

A calendar is a system for organizing time into days, weeks, months, and years. Calendars are used to track the date, plan events, and keep track of time for religious observances, historical purposes, and science.
<h3>How calendars work</h3>
Calendars are based on astronomical cycles, such as the rotation of the Earth and the revolution of the Moon and the Earth around the Sun. 
Calendars are divided into months, weeks, and days. 
A date is a specific day within a calendar. 
<h3>Types of calendars</h3>
Solar calendars: Based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun and the progression of the seasons. The Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. 
Lunar calendars: Based on the Moon's phases, or lunations. 
Julian calendar: Used in Europe until 1582 and in some countries until the 20th century. 
Other uses for calendars 
A calendar can also be a list of planned events, like a court calendar.
A calendar can also be a list of documents, like a calendar of wills.
<h3>History of calendars</h3>
The word "calendar" comes from the Latin word calendarium, which means "interest register" or "account book". 
The oldest calendar may have been found in Scotland, where archeologists discovered 12 pits aligned with the sunrise on the midwinter solstice.
